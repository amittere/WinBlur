# Privacy Policy
By using this application you consent to this privacy policy.

The app requires a NewsBlur account to function and communicates with the NewsBlur service to synchronize information about feeds you subscribe to and their content.
You can view NewsBlur's privacy policy [here](https://newsblur.com/privacy).

We respect your privacy and do not collect, store, or share any personal information other than the username and password used to login to NewsBlur.
This information is securely stored in the user's [Credential Locker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/credential-locker)
and will roam between Windows devices with the user's Microsoft account. You can sign out of the app at any time, which will delete all saved credentials and local app settings/data.
Signing out of this application does not delete your NewsBlur account - to do so, visit NewsBlur's official site and manage your account there.

Crash data and high-level analytics (described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/analytics)) are collected by Microsoft for debugging and product improvement purposes. 
This data is not used to reidentify users or expose individual user activity.
